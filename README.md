## 📄 Abstract
Blockchain can preserve an incorruptible, decentralised, and transparent log of all booking data, it's a great fit for lodging applications. Furthermore, while blockchain is transparent, it is also private, hiding any individual's identity behind complicated and secure codes that can preserve the sensitivity of booking data. The technology's decentralised structure also enables Hotel Administration and employees to communicate the same information in a secure and timely manner.

## 🗒️ Introduction
This project effectively stores the booking data on the blockchain network nowadays we see many hotel manager doing some fraud with the databases containing booking details and manipulating it for their own good and sometimes the booking details are even modified when someone gives bribes to the Hotel staff so that they can modify the previously existing data, So to keep all the data secure and transparent we have created a whole Hotel booking management system on the blockchain network where it can be kept safe and it cannot be manipulated.

### 📚 Tech stack
- Remix ETH (For Smart Contracts)
- Metamask (For the smart contract transactions)
- VS Code 
- HardHat
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- NodeJS
- Ganache 

### ⚙ Working
The block diagram above depicts how the model should work in that it will first take input from the person regarding all of the data of the choices that he wants in a hotel, such as room number and hotel name, and then the manager will check the room and inform him of its condition, as well as transfer the owner card if the person wishes to purchase it. The person will be given ownership once he has provided the appropriate amount of eth. To make this site more accessible to the general public, we've placed a converter at the top that converts eth price to inr. There's also a connect button that connects the site to Metamask and allows you to switch between the two wallets. This will input the data, which will then be saved on the blockchain network. Once the data is saved on the blockchain network, no one will be able to change it because it is on the blockchain network.

### 🔑 KEY FEATURES OF THE APP
- Data is stored on the blockchain network.
- Once the booking details are inserted then no one can modify them.
- Safe and secure on the Blockchain Network
- Hotel manager can transfer his ownership to any other Hotel.

### 🌈 CONCLUSION
The proposed solution is going to remove all sorts of Unfairness which sometimes Hotel staff does in order to manipulate the data.

### FUTURE PROSPECT
-To make our system more useful and convenient, we plan on adding a cleaner feature so that managers will get to know which room is clean or not. blockchain Network.
